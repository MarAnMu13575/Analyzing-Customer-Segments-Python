# Analyzing-Customer-Segments-Python

Background
You are a data analyst at a crowdfunding site. For the next quarter, your company will be running a marketing campaign.
The marketing manager wants to target those segments that have donated the most in the past year. 
She turned to you to help her with her upcoming meeting with the CEO.

Your challenge
Create a single visualization that the marketing manager can use to explore the data. Include:

What are the top three categories in terms of total donations?
What device type has historically provided the most contributions?
What age bracket should the campaign target?
